Tips for VIM
=============


:o	open file
:e	edit file
/	searches text
*	searches text under cursor
#	searches text under cursor backwards

:sp filename	split horizontally
:vsp filename	split vertically
<C-W>	Moves to the next split.
k	Moves to the split above the current split.
Up	Moves to the split above the current split.
j	Moves to the split below the current split.
Down	Moves to the split below the current split.
+	Increases the size of the current split by one line. (Try combining this with counts â€” e.g. 5<C-W>+ will make the split five lines bigger.)

_	(Underscore) Maximize the current split (that is, make it take up as much room as possible.)
